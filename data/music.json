      "body": "The **Spice Girls** are a British girl group formed in 1994, consisting of [Melanie Brown](openitem:mel-b) - [wiki:Melanie Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_B \"Mel B\"), also known as Mel B (\"Scary Spice\"); [Melanie Chisholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_C \"Melanie C\"), or Melanie C (\"Sporty Spice\"); [Emma Bunton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Bunton \"Emma Bunton\") (\"Baby Spice\"); [Geri Halliwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geri_Halliwell \"Geri Halliwell\") (\"Ginger Spice\"); and [Victoria Beckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Beckham \"Victoria Beckham\") (\"Posh Spice\"). With their \"[girl power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_power \"Girl power\")\" mantra, they redefined the girl-group concept by targeting a young female fanbase. They led the [teen pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_pop \"Teen pop\") resurgence of the 1990s, were a major part of the [Cool Britannia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Britannia \"Cool Britannia\") era, and became pop culture icons of the decade.\n\nThe group formed through auditions held by managers [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Herbert_(manager) \"Bob Herbert (manager)\") and [Chris Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Herbert \"Chris Herbert\"), who wanted to create a girl group to compete with the British [boy bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band \"Boy band\") popular at the time. They signed to [Virgin Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records \"Virgin Records\") and released their debut single \"[Wannabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannabe \"Wannabe\")\" in 1996, which reached number one on the charts of 37 countries. Their debut album, _[Spice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_(album) \"Spice (album)\")_ (1996), sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming [the best-selling album by a female group in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_girl_groups#Best-selling_girl_group_albums \"List of best-selling girl groups\"). The follow-up, _[Spiceworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiceworld_(album) \"Spiceworld (album)\")_ (1997), sold more than 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's [dance-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop \"Dance-pop\") style and message of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the members. In 1997, a film starring the Spice Girls, _[Spice World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_World_(film) \"Spice World (film)\"),_ was released; it was a commercial success but received poor reviews.\n\nIn May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls, citing exhaustion and creative differences. The group carried on as a four-piece with the 1998 [Spiceworld Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiceworld_Tour \"Spiceworld Tour\"), which was attended by an estimated 2.1 million people to become the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group. _[Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_(Spice_Girls_album) \"Forever (Spice Girls album)\")_ (2000), the only Spice Girls album without Halliwell, achieved weaker sales. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls entered a hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers. They reunited for two concert tours, [the Return of the Spice Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Spice_Girls_Tour \"The Return of the Spice Girls Tour\") (2007–2008) and [Spice World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_World_%E2%80%93_2019_Tour \"Spice World – 2019 Tour\") (2019), both of which won the [_Billboard_ Live Music Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Live_Music_Awards \"Billboard Live Music Awards\") for highest-grossing engagements, making them the top touring all-female group from 2000 to 2020. _[Viva Forever!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Forever!_(musical) \"Viva Forever! (musical)\")_, a musical based on the Spice Girls' music, opened in 2012; it was a critical and commercial failure and closed in 2013.\n\nMore at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Girls",
