Most of the artificial objects in outer space are in LEO.\n\nThere is a large variety of other sources that define LEO in terms of altitude. The altitude of an object in an elliptic orbit can vary significantly along the orbit. Even for circular orbits, the altitude above ground can vary by as much as 30 km (19 mi) (especially for polar orbits) due to the oblateness of Earth's spheroid figure and local topography. While definitions based on altitude are inherently ambiguous, most of them fall within the range specified by an orbit period of 128 minutes because, according to Kepler's third law, this corresponds to a semi-major axis of 8,413 km (5,228 mi). For circular orbits, this in turn corresponds to an altitude of 2,042 km (1,269 mi) above the mean radius of Earth, which is consistent with some of the upper altitude limits in some LEO definitions.",

The **Spice Girls** are a British girl group formed in 1994, consisting of [Melanie Brown](openitem:mel-b) - [wiki:Melanie Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_B "Mel B"), also known as Mel B ("Scary Spice"); [Melanie Chisholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_C "Melanie C"), or Melanie C ("Sporty Spice"); [Emma Bunton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Bunton "Emma Bunton") ("Baby Spice"); [Geri Halliwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geri_Halliwell "Geri Halliwell") ("Ginger Spice"); and [Victoria Beckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Beckham "Victoria Beckham") ("Posh Spice"). With their "[girl power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_power "Girl power")" mantra, they redefined the girl-group concept by targeting a young female fanbase.[\[1\]](#cite_note-johnharlow-1)[\[2\]](#cite_note-andrewsmith-2) They led the [teen pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_pop "Teen pop") resurgence of the 1990s, were a major part of the [Cool Britannia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Britannia "Cool Britannia") era, and became pop culture icons of the decade.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Time_magazine-3)[\[4\]](#cite_note-sherrie-4)[\[5\]](#cite_note-spice_girls_bio-5)

The group formed through auditions held by managers [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Herbert_(manager) "Bob Herbert (manager)") and [Chris Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Herbert "Chris Herbert"), who wanted to create a girl group to compete with the British [boy bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band "Boy band") popular at the time. They signed to [Virgin Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records "Virgin Records") and released their debut single "[Wannabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannabe "Wannabe")" in 1996, which reached number one on the charts of 37 countries.[\[6\]](#cite_note-bbc37-6)[\[7\]](#cite_note-Billboardwann-7) Their debut album, _[Spice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_(album) "Spice (album)")_ (1996), sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming [the best-selling album by a female group in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_girl_groups#Best-selling_girl_group_albums "List of best-selling girl groups").[\[8\]](#cite_note-US_sales-8) The follow-up, _[Spiceworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiceworld_(album) "Spiceworld (album)")_ (1997), sold more than 14 million copies worldwide.[\[9\]](#cite_note-spiceworldsales-9) Both albums encapsulated the group's [dance-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop "Dance-pop") style and message of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the members. In 1997, a film starring the Spice Girls, _[Spice World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_World_(film) "Spice World (film)"),_ was released; it was a commercial success but received poor reviews.

In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls, citing exhaustion and creative differences. The group carried on as a four-piece with the 1998 [Spiceworld Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiceworld_Tour "Spiceworld Tour"), which was attended by an estimated 2.1 million people to become the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group.[\[10\]](#cite_note-bbcatoz-10) _[Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_(Spice_Girls_album) "Forever (Spice Girls album)")_ (2000), the only Spice Girls album without Halliwell, achieved weaker sales.[\[11\]](#cite_note-simth206-11) At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls entered a hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers.

Let me repeat that: Not just the best _electric_ car, but the best car. It does just about everything really, really well."[\[22\]](#cite_note-22) In their Owner Satisfaction survey owners have consistently rated Teslas at, or near, the top rankings.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23) In 2019, _[Motor Trend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Trend "Motor Trend")_ named the 2013 Tesla Model S the ultimate "Car of the Year" over the magazine's entire 70-year history.[\[24\]](#cite_note-UltimateCar3-24) It received a refresh in June 2021.

A **battery electric vehicle** (**BEV**), **pure electric vehicle**, **only-electric vehicle**, **fully electric vehicle** or **all-electric vehicle** is a type of [electric vehicle](/wiki/Electric_vehicle "Electric vehicle") (EV) that exclusively uses [chemical energy](/wiki/Chemical_energy "Chemical energy") stored in [rechargeable battery](/wiki/Rechargeable_battery "Rechargeable battery") [packs](/wiki/Battery_pack "Battery pack"), with no secondary source of propulsion (e.g. hydrogen fuel cell, internal combustion engine, etc.). BEVs use [electric motors](/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor") and [motor controllers](/wiki/Motor_controller "Motor controller") instead of [internal combustion engines](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine "Internal combustion engine") (ICEs) for propulsion. They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine, [fuel cell](/wiki/Fuel_cell "Fuel cell"), or [fuel tank](/wiki/Fuel_tank "Fuel tank"). BEVs include – but are not limited to[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) – motorcycles, bicycles, scooters, skateboards, railcars, watercraft, forklifts, buses, trucks, and cars.

In 2016, there were 210 million electric bikes worldwide used daily.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3) Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric car vehicles passed the one million unit milestone in September 2016.[\[4\]](#cite_note-1miBEVs-4) As of October 2020[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battery_electric_vehicle&action=edit), the world's top selling all-electric car in history is the [Tesla Model 3](/wiki/Tesla_Model_3 "Tesla Model 3"), with an estimated 645,000 sales,[\[5\]](#cite_note-5) followed by the [Nissan Leaf](/wiki/Nissan_Leaf "Nissan Leaf") with over 500,000 sales as of September 2020[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battery_electric_vehicle&action=edit).[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)
